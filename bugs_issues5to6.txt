The app is actually still running, but it takes me to my phone's home screen. It reopens without any issue and all other game functions seem to be working. However, anytime I try to open the lieutenants page it closes. I tried shutting down the app and restarting it; also tried powering down the phone. No luck. Any suggestions?",

I added 3* Scorpion mid-battle eve and tried to execute over 600 health, of course failed, but message states must be 412 health, which should really read under 412 health.. However, don't think I should be able to add LT mid-battle and change my execute threshold. ;-) .Couldn't find someone between 400-411 to try to see if actually worked, but error message gave me idea it might. Will attempt next battle and update.",
