Typically I like to read the posts (some may call it lurking), but I would like to express a few things as well in this section. First, I understand the communication issue, but I do have first hand experience with getting pretty decent response from PA (thank you Airmid) in a few instances in regards to problems. I have lost items from timed out scratchers, and no they did not auto appear and yes I did check, and I have had timed out pvp and EVE, tripped more times in EVE than my ankles can take, and I absolutely despise my luck at crates.\nHowever, here's my biggest frustration....to me this game has three facets; Bosses, EVE, and PVP. Empires are all tracked by and ranked by bosses and EVE, but there is no ranking for empires in PVP. PA has essentially disregarded one third of the game's intent, and I would estimate one of the highest cash draws for the game, especially considering the events all have pvp components. I would guess its a relatively simple fix, rank empires by aggregate players pvp wins minus pvp losses. Obviously battle points would be difficult as points drop so low for higher ranks, but this also gives incentive back to empires who don't want to douse their toons with health just for EVE. Each player gets to strategically create their toon, and so should empires get to strategically create their identities.\nEVE and bosses are fun, but they are becoming stagnant. The new class skills make EVE a bit more interesting, but why not create PVP class skills? Why not create more LTs with PVP skills (thank you for Hotwire by the way, tho Hotwire should be able to steal on golden guns too ). Please PA, show us that BSI builds still have place in the game.\nOh, and PS, that spinning wheel of death before the Request Time Out is the most frustrating thing in the game.\nFREE AGENT\nReply With Quote","title":"Re: Frustrations with pa's treatment of game and forum","diffbotUri":"article|3|1251423119","pageUrl":"http://www.underworldempireforums.com/showthread.php?7390-Frustrations-with-pa-s-treatment-of-game-and-forum/page3","images":[{"diffbotUri":"image|3|-870389725","primary":true,"url":"http://underworldempireforums.com/image.php?s=38b893dd1c9cd50532a0ecb722a82b7c&u=41713&type=sigpic&dateline=1386064230"},{"diffbotUri":"image|3|823492700","url":"http://underworldempireforums.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=2667&d=1386603695"},{"diffbotUri":"image|3|146747070","url":"http://underworldempireforums.com/image.php?s=38b893dd1c9cd50532a0ecb722a82b7c&u=119&type=sigpic&dateline=1389129037"},{"diffbotUri":"image|3|-1864251332","url":"http://i.imgur.com/HHQbL67.jpg"}],"humanLanguage":"en","html":"<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://underworldempireforums.com/image.php?s=38b893dd1c9cd50532a0ecb722a82b7c&u=41713&type=sigpic&dateline=1386064230\"><\/img><\/figure>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://underworldempireforums.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=2667&d=1386603695\"><\/img><\/figure>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://underworldempireforums.com/image.php?s=38b893dd1c9cd50532a0ecb722a82b7c&u=119&type=sigpic&dateline=1389129037\"><\/img><\/figure>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/HHQbL67.jpg\"><\/img><\/figure>\n<li>   01-23-2014,&nbsp;03:25 PM   <a href=\"http://underworldempireforums.com/showthread.php?7390-Frustrations-with-pa-s-treatment-of-game-and-forum&s=38b893dd1c9cd50532a0ecb722a82b7c&p=68208&viewfull=1\">#59<\/a>       <a href=\"http://underworldempireforums.com/member.php?6449-Nitrox&s=38b893dd1c9cd50532a0ecb722a82b7c\"><strong>Nitrox<\/strong><\/a> <ul> <li> <a href=\"http://underworldempireforums.com/member.php?6449-Nitrox&s=38b893dd1c9cd50532a0ecb722a82b7c\"> View Profile <\/a> <\/li> <li> <a href=\"http://underworldempireforums.com/search.php?s=38b893dd1c9cd50532a0ecb722a82b7c&do=finduser&userid=6449&contenttype=vBForum_Post&showposts=1\"> View Forum Posts <\/a> <\/li> <li> <a href=\"http://underworldempireforums.com/private.php?s=38b893dd1c9cd50532a0ecb722a82b7c&do=newpm&u=6449\"> Private Message <\/a> <\/li> <li> <a href=\"http://underworldempireforums.com/list.php?author/6449-Nitrox&s=38b893dd1c9cd50532a0ecb722a82b7c\"> View Articles <\/a> <\/li> <\/ul>    Lackey    <dl> <dt>Join Date<\/dt> <dd>Sep 2013<\/dd> <dt>Posts<\/dt> <dd>1<\/dd> <\/dl>     <h2> Re: Frustrations with pa's treatment of game and forum <\/h2>   <blockquote> Hello all, well this is my first post on forums.

 {"icon":"http://underworldempireforums.com/favicon.ico","text":"Hey everyone,\nOkay, here's my frustrations with the game. Some may agree, some may not, but they are my frustrations.\n1: I have tried to report several bugs and issues with the game, and game play for as long as I can remember playing. Way back in the beginning you'd get a written response very quickly, often times same day. Or you could contact Airmid in game and she would have the issue resolved. Now, it takes near a week before you get the automated response \"please take a screen shot of the issue and get back to us\" - well, let me tell you, when an issue arrises during an EvE battle, the last thing on my mind is snapping a screen shot, or two... Other issues that have resulted in lost FP's, or lost stamina due to a times out attack, well for me to reproduce those issues, they are going to cost a lot of money, as it does not happen EVERY time...\n2: please listen to the community and do some investigating of issues reported instead of brushing our concerns off and signing out. By issues, I mean in game issues that are not bugs, more like harassment of any nature. Several times I have entered world chat to be bombarded with hordes of inappropriate topics and conversations that many might find offensive and border line harassment.\n3: please do not post an important update, or start an event on a Friday when you do not work on weekends to resolve issues.

This is a PvP / War game. Why is it that your battle stats almost mean nothing until you are around level 1200, then they mean everything... Because of the Lieutenants. Lower their strength by at the very least 50-75% and this will actually solve more issues then create them... Then choices of builds actually mean something. Choosing BSI or LSI, this doesn't kill LSI, it just makes their choice of game play VS PvP build more realistic. People who choose PvP build suffer the lack of game play ability (trying to get epics from bosses such as Doomsday, DragonCore, Knights Templar is virtually impossible for someone with only 240 stamina, but yet the game play build can farm his way to the very top PvP ranks... This needs to be reviewed and adjusted.\n5: crate rolls. What the heck... The other night I felt like blowing some money because I've hit a wall (so to speak) with my toon, so I decided to roll crates... 100$ later, 1 Duke, 1 Alpha, 1 Borris and a crap load of common LT's... You've got to be kidding me, right?\n6: I know communication was mentioned in issue 1, and somewhat issue 2, but those were directly related to the game and support, now this, I feel we need at least a representitive from PA acknowledging posts, providing answers and feedback, right here on the forums. I know Airmid did a fantastic job, and I know why she was removed (stepped down, call it however you want) - but there has been very little attention since that issue. I know tempers flare, and emotions get very hot when we're talking real big money investments, but guess what, every single company in the world has to deal with customer satisfaction issues all the time. There is no single company or business that can claim 100% satisfaction. You'll always have someone unsatisfied, but it's how you (PA) deal with it that makes you a strong company. Remember, you are the ones with all the power, why hide and avoid?\n7: acknowledge the people who actually work at making this a better place. The Game Guru's, posters who actually HELP the community. people who share their strategies and tricks. Each could have kept the PL guide all to himself, could have strolled right through the game. Yes, perhaps someone else MAY have posted a guide like that, but for him to take the time, and share the tricks, that in itself deserves an applause, and not only from the community, but from PA as well. Think of how many people stuck to this game by his method. Also by the way... It's not free either... That is just one example, perhaps in my mind one of the most prominent, but then you have boss guides, items guides, empire guides, the list goes on. There are people who play a game for 15 minutes, and that's their enjoyment, then you get these guys, who invest countless hours of their own time... They are the ones that keep you going. A little recognition isn't going to piss a single person here off.\nIt's very late for me, and I have a busy day tomorrow. I may add some more, as there are a few other points I want to touch on, but I have to leave it here for now.\nThanks for taking the time to read.\n-X","title":"Re: Frustrations with pa's treatment of game and forum","diffbotUri":"article|3|1251423118","pageUrl":"http://www.underworldempireforums.com/showthread.php?7390-Frustrations-with-pa-s-treatment-of-game-and-forum/page2","images":[{"diffbotUri":"image|3|-1740564787","primary":true,"url":"http://underworldempireforums.com/image.php?s=9e6aefd166852d948531e115ed76e8de&u=1202&type=sigpic&dateline=1369162168"},{"diffbotUri":"image|3|46734767","url":"http://underworldempireforums.com/image.php?s=9e6aefd166852d948531e115ed76e8de&u=1083&type=sigpic&dateline=1384741370"},{"diffbotUri":"image|3|-1864251332","url":"http://i.imgur.com/HHQbL67.jpg"},{"diffbotUri":"image|3|1785711151","url":"http://i.imgflip.com/2tk9l.gif"}],"humanLanguage":"en","html":"<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://underworldempireforums.com/image.php?s=9e6aefd166852d948531e115ed76e8de&u=1202&type=sigpic&dateline=1369162168\"><\/img><\/figure>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://underworldempireforums.com/image.php?s=9e6aefd166852d948531e115ed76e8de&u=1083&type=sigpic&dateline=1384741370\"><\/img><\/figure>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/HHQbL67.jpg\"><\/img><\/figure>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://i.imgflip.com/2tk9l.gif\"><\/img><\/figure>\n<blockquote> Hey everyone,  Okay, here's my frustrations with the game. Some may agree, some may not, but they are my frustrations.  1: I have tried to report several bugs and issues with the game, and game play for as long as I can remember playing. Way back in the beginning you'd get a written response very quickly, often times same day. Or you could contact Airmid in game and she would have the issue resolved. Now, it takes near a week before you get the automated response &quot;please take a screen shot of the issue and get back to us&quot; - well, let me tell you, when an issue arrises during an EvE battle, the last thing on my mind is snapping a screen shot, or two... Other issues that have resulted in lost FP's, or lost stamina due to a times out attack, well for me to reproduce those issues, they are going to cost a lot of money, as it does not happen EVERY time...  2: please listen to the community and do some investigating of issues reported instead of brushing our concerns off and signing out. By issues, I mean in game issues that are not bugs, more like harassment of any nature. Several times I have entered world chat to be bombarded with hordes of inappropriate topics and conversations that many might find offensive and border line harassment.  3: please do not post an important update, or start an event on a Friday when you do not work on weekends to resolve issues. I know you beta test, but how many are there testing? - I guarantee it's no 10k plus people like you have who play the live model.  4: Please review the strength of Lieutenants.
