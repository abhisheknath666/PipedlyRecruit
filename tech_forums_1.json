 {"text":"Hello, I have multiple bugs that I would like to address:\nFirst off, I constantly get the error message \"A stronger internet connection is require to play Underworld\" every time I re-open the app. This has persisted for nearly a week and I am constantly in my house with \"3 bars\" of wifi signal and have had no wifi issues with anything. The game still works after I press \"Okay\" it is just annoying to have to press it every time.\nNext, just a small bug in the \"Create Boss\" screen. When I press on a boss and then press the \"Ingredient\" to summon them, it always says I am missing the ingredients now, instead of opening a page of whatever the item is, \"Ie, Police Cellphone\" or whatever it is called. This is regardless of owning the item or not. Also the \"Ask for Items\" button doesn't do anything of course and may be misguiding to newer players who are unaware it does not work.\nFurthermore, getting hit by a player while I have the App open does not seem to notify me with a notification in the news bar. Of course, it shows when I press \"News\" but there is no red \"1\" that appears to inform me.\nAnd, when adding an ally from the news page, another notification pops up after about a minute confirming you have added them, which is rather redundant as it already says you have added them when you accept the request.\nAlso, the app notifications regarding paying respect, a boss is killed, empire is in battle, etc, are all extremely delayed and are overall not very useful.\nI know this is a bug and issue thread, but I figured I would add in a small suggestion of being able to copy and paste messages. This is mostly for the in-game function of adding boss codes and/or ally codes.\nOverall, keep up the good work, these are just small nit picky things!

It says that your battles will be resolved at 12.00 utc. How ever I could not change it back at 11.45.\nAm I doing it wrong or is there some issues with this thing?\nYou are doing something wrong.\nI understand it says it only updates 1x per day, and I understand how this is stupid for us to continue telling you, but in reality it updates every minute.\nNot sure what you did when changing times or if someone else in your empire also changed times etc BUT... to change times you should ignore the green squares and put a check beside all of the times you would like to fight.\nThanks for the reply :) I _might_ have panicked a bit as it didn't show the chances right away... Felt a little dumb. And still do :p\nIm displeased with this game. About 2 weeks ago when i tried to log in my account was gone. Whether it was hacked or given to someone else idk. I emailed support got no help. It happened to a friend of mine at the same time. He got his back 2 days later! That was 2 weeks ago. Now fast forward to today I updated the app with my other device and that account was no longer there. Instead a level 15 account. I have received absolutely no help in retrieving my 2 accounts. The first a level 70 and the second 73!\nHi,\nthere actually is a bug in selecting battle times that I can reproduce.\nMy times are from top to bottom(utc +3):\n12am\n6am\n12pm\n6pm\nWhen I select only the 12 am battle it selects the 12 pm battle. And vice versa. The 6 a'clock times work as they should.\nIt's not that bad when you know how it works. But it's definitely not working as it should.\n-S\nOne bug I found is that sometimes the tiles up top on the screen (health, money, stamina, energy) will oftentimes get stuck with a 50% transparent white square on top of them. For example, when you click them they turn that white-ish color for a second to show that your click has been registered -- sometimes when I open up the app it permanently has this square on it until I touch it.\nAnother bug that I found is that oftentimes, an extra error message will pop up when a chat error occurs. Whether this chat error is due to the fact that it has been less than 5 seconds since the last message or that \"too many people are chatting\" (upgrade the server >.<), and extra error pops up after that. The error reads \"ERROR RETRIEVING CHAT DATA.\" I feel like this code was probably left in accidentally, if maybe there was a point where that one error message covered everything until the 5 seconds one and the other one were added.\nThis has probably been covered somewhere else, but it's 2 am and I'm a bit too tired to search. That said:\nIssue: gameplay/pvp\nFor the last 8 hours, I haven't been able to see who's been attacking me. The last one that shows up on my feed was from 6 hrs ago, previous to that is 15hrs ago. I just watched my health go from full to zero, checked my news feed, hoping to see who used 20 stamina to kill me, and those two are still there. Not the first time this has happened. Normally, I remove a few of the people from the feed and the rest appear. Not the case this time.

I understand it says it only updates 1x per day, and I understand how this is stupid for us to continue telling you, but in reality it updates every minute.  Not sure what you did when changing times or if someone else in your empire also changed times etc BUT... to change times you should ignore the green squares and put a check beside all of the times you would like to fight.<\/blockquote>  <\/li><li>  <blockquote>Thanks for the reply :) I _might_ have panicked a bit as it didn't show the chances right away... Felt a little dumb. And still do :p<\/blockquote>  <\/li><li>  <blockquote>Im displeased with this game. About 2 weeks ago when i tried to log in my account was gone. Whether it was hacked or given to someone else idk. I emailed support got no help. It happened to a friend of mine at the same time. He got his back 2 days later! That was 2 weeks ago. Now fast forward to today I updated the app with my other device and that account was no longer there. Instead a level 15 account. I have received absolutely no help in retrieving my 2 accounts. The first a level 70 and the second 73!<\/blockquote>  <\/li><li>  <blockquote>Hi,   there actually is a bug in selecting battle times that I can reproduce.  My times are from top to bottom(utc +3): 12am 6am 12pm 6pm When I select only the 12 am battle it selects the 12 pm battle. And vice versa. The 6 a'clock times work as they should. It's not that bad when you know how it works. But it's definitely not working as it should.  -S<\/blockquote>  <\/li><li>  <blockquote>One bug I found is that sometimes the tiles up top on the screen (health, money, stamina, energy) will oftentimes get stuck with a 50% transparent white square on top of them. For example, when you click them they turn that white-ish color for a second to show that your click has been registered -- sometimes when I open up the app it permanently has this square on it until I touch it.<\/blockquote>  <\/li><li>  <blockquote>Another bug that I found is that oftentimes, an extra error message will pop up when a chat error occurs. Whether this chat error is due to the fact that it has been less than 5 seconds since the last message or that &quot;too many people are chatting&quot; (upgrade the server &gt;.&lt;), and extra error pops up after that. The error reads &quot;ERROR RETRIEVING CHAT DATA.&quot; I feel like this code was probably left in accidentally, if maybe there was a point where that one error message covered everything until the 5 seconds one and the other one were added.<\/blockquote>  <\/li><li>  <blockquote>This has probably been covered somewhere else, but it's 2 am and I'm a bit too tired to search. That said: Issue: gameplay/pvp  For the last 8 hours, I haven't been able to see who's been attacking me. The last one that shows up on my feed was from 6 hrs ago, previous to that is 15hrs ago. I just watched my health go from full to zero, checked my news feed, hoping to see who used 20 stamina to kill me, and those two are still there. Not the first time this has happened. Normally, I remove a few of the people from the feed and the rest appear. Not the case this time.

But at least give us a response... Just like tell me u are aware of this problem and are working on it. That's all I'm asking for.\nThx devs.  Pls keep being awesome!\nI'm battle rank 14 and now when I look at the home screen, instead of seeing how many points I have towards my next rank, it just says \"Battle other players for rank\". Did the developers take that away or is my app just being dumb?\nIt means you lost too many battles, therefore, too many points and you are under what you should be. Keep fighting and when you have the correct amount of points for your rank it will show you your points again\nIt means you lost too battles, therefore, too many points and you are under what you should be. Keep fighting and when you have the correct amount of points for your rank it will show you your points again\nThanks buddy\nThanks for this note. I just did some testing on my own account as well as the beta. In the beta build 1.42, which is the next update, this is not an issue. However it seems in the current production build (1.37), if you access your wall from your profile the red X User interface disappears but the function is still there. If you access it from your news feed, the red \"x\" is there.\nIf you want to see the red X, for a couple of days just access from the newsfeed instead of profile.\nThank u Manimal I think u are right, it's happening to a lot of empires but for some reason only a handful of empires get really huge number of wars they didn't fight...I suspect it's because they constantly change their war times to b able to fight 4 wars a day, because I know some ppl in those empires and coincidently those with 150 wars credited a month are those who always fight 4 wars a day...\nIf u want u can check the General Discussion there's a thread called \"How could some empires fight 150 wars a month?\"... That was how I first spotted something might b wrong coz in the month of April they fought 150 wars...\nThank u and hope u guys find out what's going on and fix it soon. ","title":"Bug and Issue Thread v1.0","diffbotUri":"article|3|237101173","pageUrl":"http://www.underworldempireforums.com/printthread.php?t=1877&pp=20&page=3","humanLanguage":"en","html":"<ul> <li>  <blockquote>Several empires are being credited 5 wars a day within a 24 hr period.

 {"text":"Hi, love the game so far but encountered my first bug today. Details below. Thanks!\nIssue Category - Gameplay\nArmy Code -\nTime - 11:00 am (recurring), US Central Time, June 6, 2013\nScreen Shot - n/a\nIssue Description - I received a new lieutenant and the lieutenant button showed a message icon. When I try to access the lieutenant page the game freezes for a second then closes. The app is actually still running, but it takes me to my phone's home screen. It reopens without any issue and all other game functions seem to be working. However, anytime I try to open the lieutenants page it closes. I tried shutting down the app and restarting it; also tried powering down the phone. No luck. Any suggestions?\nTry updating to version 1.42. If this does not help, contact us again.\nHi, love the game so far but encountered my first bug today. Details below.

Different screen res, ect.\nWe needed to keep aspect ratio the same as on phone. If we did not make this concession there would not be an iPad version.\nBug or feature? I added 3* Scorpion mid-battle eve and tried to execute over 600 health, of course failed, but message states must be 412 health, which should really read under 412 health.\nHowever, don't think I should be able to add LT mid-battle and change my execute threshold. ;-)\nCouldn't find someone between 400-411 to try to see if actually worked, but error message gave me idea it might.
