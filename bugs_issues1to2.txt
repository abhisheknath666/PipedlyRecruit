Becomes annoying to the point that it's hard to go heavy on bosses where heavy is good because random people join and knock out a couple of the bosses, nullifying the usefulness of a heavy class. Most of my empire mates are experiencing the same thing. Hope it gets fixed soon!.",

Here's an example: Sent everyone a ak-47 and one person in my empire didn't receive it (didn't check with others). I sent that same person a diamond by selecting him only. He received the ak-47... That to me shows gifting is flawed. Another example is I know one guy in my empire sends out a ak-47 to all his ally list and asked if I received any. I have not.To me it seems if you wanna gift you have to do it through that persons profile. And sometimes even then that's hit and miss. The gift all doesn't even work properly on castle age either. I noticed there it only sends to like the top 15 people name wise. Which makes me wonder if that's how it is in this game. Which basically defeats the purpose of having a select all/gift all. I'm not complaining or anything, just if gifting is working as intended I'd like to know the intention of gifting . I do love that you guys are working hard to make an excellent game and I absolutely love the game. Just wish gifting worked properly",
