I'm not asking u guys to fix it asap coz I know u are pretty busy and are working hard. But at least give us a response... Just like tell me u are aware of this problem and are working on it.

If u want u can check the General Discussion there's a thread called Howcouldsomeempiresfight150warsamonth?... That was how I first spotted something might b wrong coz in the month of April they fought 150 wars. Thank u and hope u guys find out what's going on and fix it soon.",
